						React Native
================================================================
-React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. 
-It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.
-With React Native, you don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, or a hybrid app; 
-you build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. 
-React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. 
-You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.
